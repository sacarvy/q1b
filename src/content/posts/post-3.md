# My Third Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-15

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Adding Pagination**

2. **Adding Global Styles**

3. **Adding Data Directory**

## What's next

It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!
