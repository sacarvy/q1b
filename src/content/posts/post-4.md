# My Forth Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-15

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Upgrading to Astro 2.1**

2. **Publishing to Github**

3. **Building in Public**

## What's next

This post should show up with my other blog posts, because `Astro.glob()` is returning a list of all my posts in order to create my list.
